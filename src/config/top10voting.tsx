          Kanye West. Besides the fact that he grew up near me, his music has always resonated with me more than any other artist. The diversity of his discography is something I try to do with my music, looking for unique sounds and samples.

          What is your proudest music moment so far?
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant='body2' color='textPrimary'>
          As of 2020, I would say the biggest most exciting moment of my music career actually happened just recently! I hit 100K monthly listeners on Spotify, my single “Green Tea & Honey” is #1 on the Thailand Top 50 Viral charts & just hit 1 million streams on Spotify alone. This is the first time I’ve ever hit numbers like this and I’m super proud of it.

          I'm inspired by Ed Sheeran, Taylor Swift and Sia since they write their own music and you can feel their deep emotions in their lyrics.

          It is my way to express deep emotions that I could never express by just talking. It is special to me because I find that it’s a good way to help others who might be feeling the same way. Music can change moods and can be a part of your world, that’s the effect I want on people.

          Proudest moment in my music career is honestly building the courage and confidence to enter the SUTTM and making Top 30! Being that I was always scared of showing the world my musical talents, this was the first ever freestyle I had ever put into the world and for it to go as far as this, couldn’t be more proud.
