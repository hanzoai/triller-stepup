Each “audition video” properly created, uploaded, and tagged will count as one (1) entry (an “<strong>Initial</strong> <strong>Entry</strong>”). If an Entrant fails to link his/her Triller Account to his/her Instagram Account, fails to post the Initial Entry publicly within the Triller App, fails to post the Initial Entry with the proper #@ tags, or otherwise fails to comply with the other eligibility rules described herein, the Initial Entry will be deemed ineligible and will not count and will be voided.

If an Entrant does not already have the Instagram App (or an Instagram Account) or has not linked his/her Instagram Account with his/her Triller Account, he/she may download the Instagram App for free from Google Play or the App Store, register a new Instagram Account at no cost in accordance with Instagram’s Terms of Service (<Link target='_blank' href="https://help.instagram.com/581066165581870">https://help.instagram.com/581066165581870</Link>), Platform Policy (<Link target='_blank' href="https://help.instagram.com/325135857663734">https://help.instagram.com/325135857663734</Link>), and Privacy Policy (<Link target='_blank' href="https://help.instagram.com/519522125107875">https://help.instagram.com/519522125107875</Link>), and then, within the Triller App, select the profile icon at the bottom of the home screen and then select “Edit Profile” to enter his/her “Instagram Username” in the field provided. To ensure an Initial Entry is publicly viewable, the Entrant must select the profile icon at the bottom of the home screen and then “Edit Profile” to make sure “Private Account” is deselected or unchecked and ensure when posting the Initial Entry that the “Set to Private” option is deselected or toggled off. All Initial Entries must be received during the Entry Period in order <span style={{color: 'white'}}>to be eligible</span>. Each Initial Entry may only feature the applicable Entrant and not any other person, must be in either the English or Spanish languages, must contain a live vocal performance by the Entrant, and may not exceed thirty (30) seconds in duration. The vocal performance featured in each Initial Entry may only be an original work, or a cover of a song that is otherwise available through the music library contained in the Triller App at the time of submission of the Initial Entry&nbsp;(“<strong>Triller Library</strong>”).
